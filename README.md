# FIWARE-Smart-Home-System
Designed and implemented a modular smart home system using FIWARE components, focusing on real-time monitoring, historical analytics, and semantic interoperability. The project demonstrated practical integration of IoT devices into a unified architecture, with containerized deployment and secure access control.

The solution was presented in a peer-reviewed paper at the CSCS25 conference and published in IEEE.
